			<h3>My Pokemon IV Breeding Probability Calculator (Gen VI)</h3>

			<br>&emsp;(This file is safe, I promise)
			<div class="sectionPokemon">
				<div class="column">
					<p>
						This calculator program deals with the breeding mechanics for the 6th generation of Pokemon.
						It also handles the possibilities of the Pokemon holding any combination of breeding-mechanic-altering items
						(e.g. Destiny Knot, Power Weight (HP), Power Bracer (Atk), Power Belt (Def), Power Lens (SpA), Power Band (SpD), and Power Anklet (Spe)).
						Lastly it tackles the chances of when overlapping IVs occur, such as when the HP IVs of both parents are selected to be passed down to the offspring.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<br>&emsp; Games of the 6th generation include:
					<ul>
						<li>Pokemon X</li>
						<li>Pokemon Y</li>
						<li>Pokemon Omega Ruby</li>
						<li>Pokemon Alpha Sapphire</li>
					</ul>
					<br>&emsp; Anecdotal: This calculator program also works for the 7th generation of Pokemon; as the breeding mechanics remain unchanged.
					Games of the 7th generation include:
					<ul>
						<li>Pokemon Sun</li>
						<li>Pokemon Moon</li>
						<li>Pokemon Ultra Sun</li>
						<li>Pokemon Ultra Moon</li>

			<h3>My Steve's 2D World game</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./steves2dworld/Steves2DWorld.zip">Steve's 2D World</a>
			<p>
				This game is a project I did when I took the CSE 380 Game Programming course.
				We were required to create a 2D pc game. For mine I went for a hack-and-slash type of game.
				I borrowed elements from Super Mario Bros. for the level design,
				including features such as reaching from point a to b, and platform jumping.
				The player and monsters were inspired from my time playing Fire Emblem: The Scared Stones.
				<br>The artwork for the player and monsters were drawn by my roommate of that year (Thank you David).

			<h3>My Hotel Management System project</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./hotelmanagementsystem/HotelManagementSystem.zip">Hotel Management System</a>
			<p>
				This project was done for my CSE 333 class.
				For my project I decided to implement a hotel management system.
				This program permitted 3 types of users (customers, employees, managers) to access the system.
				The program gave various functions depending on the user type (ordering food, checking in/out of rooms,
				changing the breakfast/lunch/dinner menu, etc).

			<h3>My CIA Factbook Mapper project</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./ciafactbookmapper/CIAFactbookMapper.zip">CIA Factbook Mapper</a>
			<p>
				This is a project I did for my CSE 219 class.
				We were tasked with designing a GUI based project displaying a map of the world.
				Additionally we were required to present a way for displaying various statistical information
				(such as number of airports, population, etc) via a color methods.
