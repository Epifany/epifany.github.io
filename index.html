			<h3>Pokemon Genetics Probability Calculator (Gen 6) 2.0</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./pokemon/PokemonGeneticsProbabilityCalculatorGen6v2.jar" class="download">DOWNLOAD</a>
			<p>This calculator is a new and updated version of my previous calculator.</p>
			<br>&emsp; Some changes include:
			<ul>
				<li>A new UI has been implemented, with the intended goal of being more compact, intuitive, and easy to use.</li>
				<li>You can now select Everstone as an item.
					It's assumed that the Pokemon carrying the Everstone is the one with the correct/desired Nature that the player is looking for.</li>
				<li>Users can now choose to see the probabilities as a percentage.</li>
				<li>A new approach, to how IVs may have been passed down to the baby Pokemon, has been implemented.</li>
				<li>Users can switch between the new and previous approach in the calculator.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>
				The new approach, currently called the "Slot" approach, is a different take on how the IVs are passed from parents to the baby.
				In the Slot approach, the program selects a number of "stat slots" (e.g. HP, Atk, Def, SpA, SpD, Spe),
				then (for each stat slot) proceeds to select the IV from either parent to inherit.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The previous calculator uses the "Marble" approach, and is still included in the new calculator.
				In the Marble approach, the program treats all IVs as "marbles" and selects a number of marbles for the baby to inherit.
				This approach gives way to chances of overlap, such as when the HP IVs of both parents are selected.

			<h3>Pokemon IV Breeding Probability Calculator (Gen VI)</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./pokemon/PokemonIVBreedingProbabilityCalculator_GenVI.jar" class="download">DOWNLOAD</a>
			<p>
				This calculator <a href="https://github.com/Epifany/PokemonIVBreedingProbabilityCalculator-Gen.6-" target="_blank">program</a> deals with the breeding mechanics for the 6th generation of Pokemon.
				It also handles the possibility of the Pokemon holding any combination of breeding mechanic altering items
				(e.g. Destiny Knot, Power Weight (HP), Power Bracer (Atk), Power Belt (Def), Power Lens (SpA), Power Band (SpD), and Power Anklet (Spe)).
				Lastly it tackles the chances of when overlapping IVs occur, such as when the HP IVs of both parents are selected to be passed down to the offspring.
				There are many great guides online on IV breeding such as
				<a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/breeding-perfect-pokemon-in-pokemon-x-y.3490432/" target="_blank">this</a> one.
			</p>
			<br>&emsp; Games of the 6th generation include:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.pokemonxy.com" target="_blank">Pokemon X</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.pokemonxy.com" target="_blank">Pokemon Y</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com" target="_blank">Pokemon Omega Ruby</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com" target="_blank">Pokemon Alpha Sapphire</a></li>
			</ul>
			<br>&emsp; Anecdotal: This calculator program also works for the 7th generation of Pokemon; as the breeding mechanics remain unchanged.
			Games of the 7th generation include:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-sun-and-pokemon-moon/" target="_blank">Pokemon Sun</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-sun-and-pokemon-moon/" target="_blank">Pokemon Moon</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-pokemon-ultra-moon/" target="_blank">Pokemon Ultra Sun</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-ultra-sun-and-pokemon-ultra-moon/" target="_blank">Pokemon Ultra Moon</a></li>

			<h3>My Steve's 2D World game</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./steves2dworld/Steves2DWorld.zip" class="download">DOWNLOAD</a>
			<p>
				This is a 2D PC game I did during my time as an undergraduate; going for a hack-and-slash type of game.
				I borrowed elements from
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros." target="_blank">Super Mario Bros.</a>
				for the level design, including features such as reaching from point a to b, and platform jumping.
				The player and monsters were inspired from my time playing
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_The_Sacred_Stones" target="_blank">Fire Emblem: The Scared Stones</a>.
				<br>The artwork for the player, monsters, and mouse cursor were drawn by my roommate of that year (Thank you David).

			<h3>My Hotel Management System project</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./hotelmanagementsystem/HotelManagementSystem.zip" class="download">DOWNLOAD</a>
			<p>
				This was a hotel management system project I did as an undergraduate.
				This program permitted 3 types of users (customers, employees, managers) to access the system.
				The program gave various functions depending on the user type (ordering food, checking in/out of rooms,
				changing the breakfast/lunch/dinner menu, etc).

			<h3>My CIA Factbook Mapper project</h3>
			&emsp;<a href="./ciafactbookmapper/CIAFactbookMapper.zip" class="download">DOWNLOAD</a>
			<p>
				This was one of the first large projects I did as an undergraduate. 
				This was a GUI based project displaying a world map; 
				making use of various statistical information such as population per country, number of airports per country, etc. 
				I gave users 3 different ways to view information.
				The first is a world map view where statistical information is presented by means of a color gradient. 
				Users are given the freedom to select what colors they'd like to use for the color gradient.
				The second is a table view where all the information can be presented at once. 
				The last is a table view providing a detail description of each field (e.g. population, number of airports, etc). 
				These views are designed to allow users to analyze, view, and explore various statistics from the world.
